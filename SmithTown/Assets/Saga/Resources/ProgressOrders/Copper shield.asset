  description: 'The creaking of wheels came from behind the threshold - a cart pulled
    up to the forge. A heavy merchant with an intricate amulet around his neck jumped
    down from it with difficulty. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and, without
    wasting time, began to speak:



    - Lately, it is impossible to leave the
    road to the south without protection. Bandits, animals... I want a shield. Copper.
    Reliable, so that it will reflect blows and inspire confidence.



    You examined
    it. Copper is not steel, but in skilled hands, even it can be made into a strong
    shield.'
