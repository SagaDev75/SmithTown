  description: 'Late in the evening, a miner looked into the forge - broad-shouldered,
    with soot on his face and a heavy gait. He took off his knapsack and leaned on
    the edge of the table, breathing heavily, as if he had just come out of the mine.

    

    -
    I need a hammer. A metal one, all of it. Wood doesn''t live in a mine - it rots
    and cracks. And I need it to hold. For a long time.

    

    He wasn''t talking
    about a weapon, but about a real tool - a massive head, all-metal construction,
    a minimum of seams. The handle is wrapped in leather for a better grip, the weight
    is shifted closer to the center to reduce recoil. A tool created for work underground,
    in stone and darkness.'
