  description: "In the morning, when the forge had not yet warmed up from the coals,
    a rider on a black horse rode up to it. The armored harness on the animal gleamed,
    and the rider himself was dressed in a traveling, but obviously expensive waistcoat.
    He dismounted slowly, as if time belonged to him, and spoke with a slight smile:\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    need a sword. Special. So that it not only cuts, but also speaks for me. Exquisite.
    Expensive. Such that it would be recognized at first sight.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe spoke
    of the blade as if it were a jewel: a thin blade with an engraving, a guard in
    the form of spread wings, decorated with precious stones. The handle is made
    of rare wood, balanced, with a chasing on the pommel. The sword is not for combat
    - for status, for legends, for those who know how to wear a weapon as an extension
    of their own name."
