  description: "A man in a grey cloak entered the forge under the sound of rain.
    At first, only a silhouette on the threshold was visible, but as he came closer,
    it became clear that an empty scabbard was hanging at his side. He took off his
    hood and spoke in a low, calm voice:\r\n\r\n\u201CI need a copper sword. Light,
    without frills. So that I could wear it every day, but in case of need, I could
    stand up for myself.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe sword should be simple, but reliable -
    with a straight blade, a comfortable guard and a leather-wrapped hilt. No decorations,
    no extra weight. Just what is really needed."
