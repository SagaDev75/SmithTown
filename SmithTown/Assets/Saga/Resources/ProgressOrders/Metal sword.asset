  description: 'In the middle of the day, when it was dry and hot outside, a young
    fighter ran into the forge - light armor, a sling across his chest, and dust
    and haste on his face. He hardly stopped, just took a quick look and said quickly,
    to the point:

    

    - I need a sword. Iron. Light and fast. I am not armored,
    speed is more important to me than strength.

    

    He spoke like someone
    who is used to dodging, not blocking. Such a sword should be narrow, elongated,
    with an emphasis on balance and the sharpness of the blow. Minimum weight, maximum
    control - to deliver a series of blows without losing maneuverability. The handle
    is without excess, the guard is compact but reliable.'
