  description: 'A hunter looked into the forge - tall, with a wrinkled face and a
    look as sharp as a knife blade. An empty quiver dangled from his back, and a
    knife in a worn sheath hung from his belt. He took off his hood and, without
    wasting words, said:

    

    - I need a copper axe. Not a combat one. For
    the forest. To chop branches, and firewood for the camp.

    

    You looked
    closely at his hands - strong, with calluses, clearly familiar with the tool.
    Such a person will not tolerate poor quality work. The blade must be sharp, the
    handle comfortable, and the balance - accurate, like a shot from a bow.'
