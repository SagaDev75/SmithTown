  description: "A young wanderer emerged from a dusty road winding through the hills.
    Dressed in a tattered cloak and carrying a knapsack, he looked around cautiously
    before entering the forge. As he approached, he spoke quietly, as if afraid of
    being overheard:\r\n\r\n\u201CI need a wooden sword\u2026 For training,\u201D
    he said, avoiding my eyes. \u201CNot a combat one, just to get my hand in.\u201D"
